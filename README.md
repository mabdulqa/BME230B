# BME230B - Advanced Computational Genomics and Systems Biology
This course is the final part of BME230 series in UCSC, while 230A was BSc capstone - I chose to take BME230B for knowledge sake. I do not regret this course - as BME230A did set up for this course quite nicely. While 230A focused more on Genomics, this poriton of the 230 series focused on Systems Biology - a field that I grew to like through out the time of this course. The course had 3 portions - Bayesian networks and bayesian modeling - where we learned how to find the probabilites of certain illnesses given certain components in a netowork full of factors. Like for example the probability of having covid-19 given high community spread. Or probability of having an illness given the test was positive. The next portion was single cell analysis - mainly through scanpy and gseapy - while using dynamic programming and kruskal algorithm to find the minimum wieght spanning tree of a gene network. Finally was the clustering protion of the course where using PCA, louvian, and K-means alogrithms we cluster samples based on thier cell types and by other expression factors. 
The final project of this course was a special case where each team had to find a CoVID 19 drug target. Our project is expalined in more detail in the Final_Project folder.
